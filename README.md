[Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge)-Archery

## Supplies
- Four persons, or persons in integer multiples of four.
- Archery Target (3" @ 10m)
- Laser Target (1" @ 5m)
- Recurve Bow
- 13 Arrows w/ Field Tips
- Laser Pistol
- Optional : a wood-fire over which to shoot at least the arrows

## Play
- [Bidding proceeds as normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidding_system). Once you know who will be the dummy under that contract, ask the dummy to bid a type (Bow or Pistol), and a hit rate (1-13).
- Opposing partnership has the option to double the dummy's bid.
- Dummy, if doubled, has the option to redouble.
- The dummy gets up and readies themselves for one shot per trick.
- Bridge play proceeds. With each trick played, dummy at the range will take one shot with either pistol or bow at the appropriate target.
- If the dummy hits inside the target ring (3" for archery at 10m, 1" for laser at 5m), the dummy gets one point toward satisfying their contract. Hits on the line of the target ring count as a hit inside the target ring.
- If the dummy hits outside the target ring, the dummy does not get a point toward their contract.
- At the conclusion of the hand, the dummy will have fired 13 shots/arrows at the target. The number inside the target ring are counted and the sum compared to the bid. - If the dummy satisfied their bid, their partnership receives 50 points "above the line", adjusted as appropriate for double/redouble.
- If the dummy did not satisfy their bid, the opposing partnership receives 50 points "above the line", adjusted as appropriate for double/redouble.
